### Robosuite and TD3 RL algo

This work is adapted from the public tutorials of Robert Cowher

The goal is to train a robotic arm to do some task in Robosuite.
The training algorithm is called TD3 and uses 6 different neural networks.

It also explicitly detail the construction of the TD3 algorithm, for math entusiasts.
